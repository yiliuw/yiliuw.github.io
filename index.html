					<h3> About Me </h3>
					<p> I am currently a Research Scientist and Shanahan Fellow at the <a href="https://alleninstitute.org">Allen Institute</a>. I am working in both the Data-Driven Discovery (D3) center and the Brain & Consciousness group. I am also affiliated with the Computational Neuroscience Center at University of Washington (UW-CNC). At Allen Institute, I address fundamental questions in neuroscience by developing advanced mathematical models that bridge AI and brain research. </p>

					<br>

					<p>Prior to joining the Allen Institute, I earned my PhD in Statistics from London School of Economics <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics">(LSE)</a>. I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://personal.lse.ac.uk/vojnovic/">Prof. Milan Vojnovic</a> and supported by the Lee Family Scholarship. I also worked with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/weic/">Prof. Wei Chen</a> at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) as a research intern in the summer of year 2021. Before my PhD, I spent my undergraduate at <a href="https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk">St John's College</a> of the University of Oxford and received a master's degree in mathematics and statistics in 2018.</p>
					<br>

					<h3> Research Interests</h3>
					<p>From my PhD, Iâ€™ve been working on a Relational learning, i.e., learning in a context where we have a group of items with relationships.  Relational learning enables effective reasoning about richly structured data. It is an interdisciplinary field that uses machine learning, statistics, and applied probability methods to extract insights from datasets. I am interested in the underlying statistical inference, optimization, approximation and learning problems.</p>
					<br>

					<p>My work at Allen Institute spans both spatial and temporal analysis for neuronal dataset, with a common theme of exploring the neuronal population as groups. Neurons grouped into cell types to subserve cognitive functions. They spike and interact differently when the brain state changes, during biological development and at the disease onset. I find neuronal dataset an ideal testing ground for relational learning methods and a source of inspiration for advancing them.
